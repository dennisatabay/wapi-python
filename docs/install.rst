Installation
============

If you have an existing python environment installed, 
you can simply install the Wattsight API python library with pip::

    pip install -U https://github.com/wattsight/wapi-python/archive/master.zip
    


No python installed yet
-----------------------

1. Download and install `Anaconda`_ (Python 3.X). Choose the 64-bit installer 
   if possible. During the installation, keep both checkboxes "modify PATH" 
   and "register Python" selected!
2. Install the Wattsight API python library with pip by copying the
   following line to your command shell::

        pip install -U https://github.com/wattsight/wapi-python/archive/master.zip


 
WE SHOULD put wapi-python to PyPI in order to make the installation simpler!

        
.. note::
    
    It is also possible to install python and pip manually (without Anaconda)
